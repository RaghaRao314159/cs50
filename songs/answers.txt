1. The auras can be categorised as such using the mean values of a single person's playlist.

Purple: High danceability (80 percentile)
Green: valence aligns with the general population's mean
Pink: High valence (80 percentile)
Orange: High energy (80 percentile)
Yellow: Every value is in the 65th percentile.
Blue: Extreme ends of valence (80 percentile)

2. First and foremost, this data does not consider the total hearing time of the songs. Some songs may be listened to for many
more hours but not properly accounted for when they are simply inserted into a top 100 list. Hearing time should be included as a weighted
metric when calculating songs,

This method may be succeptible to the songs that became popular in that year. The latest trend of 'pop' songs for example
might influence the type of songs users listen to, increasing the average danceability of a user. Another issue is that many
highly dancable songs are more commonly consumed on other visual platfors like tiktok or youtube while the mellow songs are
preferrebly consumed on spotify. This again introduces a bias. To solve these issues, one might have to consider data for more
than a year.
